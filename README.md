# HyperVTool
Manage Hyper-V virtual machines state from command line.

There is a nice "HyperVUtils" application that allows you to start/stop VMs in the Hyper-V.

However it is not able to "save state" of the VM (and resume it later). So, with a generous help of CoPilot, I wrote an application that does all necessary commands.

Note - unfortunately, right now only start, stop, reboot and reset commands work. Save, Pause, and Resume don't work.
